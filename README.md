## Research Overview

We propose an enhanced approach to real-world image super-resolution by integrating **Quave preprocessing** into the pipeline, enabling richer feature embeddings to feed into the **time-aware encoder** of the StableSR framework.

This work combines the strengths of **StableSR**, a state-of-the-art super-resolution framework, and **QUAVE**, a quaternion wavelet-based preprocessing tool, to achieve superior generalization and performance for image analysis tasks.

### Baseline: StableSR Framework

This work builds on the **StableSR** model, which leverages diffusion priors for real-world image super-resolution.

### Key Contributions
- **Quave Preprocessing**: Extracts advanced embeddings to enhance input quality.
- **Time-Aware Encoder**: Integrates temporal and feature-rich embeddings for improved image fidelity.
- **Real-World Applications**: Targets arbitrary upscaling with minimal artifacts.

## Pipeline Overview

1. **Input Preprocessing**: Quave processes the low-resolution (LR) image, extracting salient sub-band features.
2. **Diffusion Prior**: StableSRâ€™s encoder-decoder generates latent codes.
3. **Time-Aware Encoding**: Combines Quave embeddings with temporal features for enhanced decoding.

## Integration of QUAVE

### About Quave
The **Quaternion Wavelet Network (QUAVE)** is a novel framework designed to generalize image representations. It enhances neural model performance by extracting and selecting frequency sub-bands to provide approximation and fine-grained features, offering a more complete input representation for image processing tasks.
