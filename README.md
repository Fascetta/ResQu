# ResQu - Quaternion Wavelet-Conditioned Diffusion for Super-Resolution

## Overview

ResQu is a **Quaternion Wavelet-Conditioned Diffusion Model** designed to enhance image super-resolution tasks. This method introduces **quaternion wavelet embeddings** to improve feature representation, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with improved perceptual quality.

## Methodology

ResQu leverages a **multi-scale frequency decomposition** using quaternion wavelets, feeding wavelet-conditioned embeddings into a diffusion model. The architecture consists of:
1. **Wavelet Decomposition**: Extracts low- and high-frequency components.
2. **Quaternion Embeddings**: Encodes spatial-frequency information.
3. **Diffusion-Based Enhancement**: Refines reconstructions through iterative denoising.
